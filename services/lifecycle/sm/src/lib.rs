//! # PRoT Lifecycle State Machine — Runtime
//!
//! The event-driven run-loop that drives the [`State`] graph defined in
//! `openprot_lifecycle_api`. This is the Rust port of the body of
//! `AspeedStateMachine()`: a `loop { recv(); decide; run; }` over a blocking
//! event queue.
//!
//! ## Decoupling
//!
//! The loop is generic over two traits so it carries no OS, transport, or
//! hardware dependency — matching how the MCTP server keeps platform
//! primitives out of its core:
//!
//! - [`EventQueue`] — the blocking event source/sink. On a real target this is
//!   backed by a `pw_kernel` IPC channel; in tests it is an in-memory queue.
//!   This replaces the Zephyr `k_fifo`.
//! - [`Actions`] — the work performed on entering a state (verify, recover,
//!   update, …). On a real target each method calls into OpenPRoT services and
//!   HAL traits (`Digest`, `Ecdsa`, the fwupdate service); in tests it is a
//!   scripted double. Handlers return the follow-up [`Event`] they want fed
//!   back into the loop — the same contract as `GenerateStateMachineEvent`.
