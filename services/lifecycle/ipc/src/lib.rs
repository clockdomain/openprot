//! # Lifecycle IPC Server Binding
//!
//! The on-target binding that drives [`LifecycleServer`] over a `pw_kernel` IPC
//! channel. This is the server (handler) end of the lifecycle channel: it reads
//! one request, runs it through the platform-independent service, and writes the
//! response back — the `channel_read` → handle → `channel_respond` shape of
//! `StreamServer::handle_ipc`.
//!
//! ## Layering
//!
//! - The wire codec lives in `openprot_lifecycle_api::wire` (host-tested there).
//! - The decode → drive → encode logic lives in
//!   `openprot_lifecycle_server::LifecycleServer` (platform-independent and
//!   host-tested).
//! - This crate adds only the `pw_kernel` `userspace` syscalls
//!   (`channel_read`, `channel_respond`), which build on-target only. It is
//!   therefore target-only and carries no host tests; its logic is exercised by
//!   the host tests of the two crates above.
//!
//! ## Follow-up events
//!
//! While [`LifecycleServer::handle_request`] runs the machine to quiescence, the
//! handlers' follow-up events ([`Event::VerifyDone`] etc.) are produced
//! in-process. They never cross the kernel: they are buffered in a small
//! in-process [`LocalQueue`] and drained within the same request. Only the
//! externally-meaningful request/response crosses the channel.
