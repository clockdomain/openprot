//! # PRoT Lifecycle State Machine — API
//!
//! Target-agnostic state, event, and transition definitions for the OpenPRoT
//! platform lifecycle (secure-boot / verify / recovery / update / runtime).
//!
//! This crate is the Rust port of the architecture used by ASPEED's
//! `AspeedStateMachine`: a single-threaded, event-driven finite state machine
//! whose states form the PRoT boot-and-runtime lifecycle. Only the *shape* is
//! carried over — the transition graph and the "a handler runs work, then emits
//! the next event" drive model. The Zephyr `smf.h` machinery, `union` event
//! payloads, and manual allocation are replaced with plain Rust enums and a
//! pure transition function.
//!
//! ## What lives here vs. the `sm` crate
//!
//! This crate holds *only* data and pure logic: the [`State`] and [`Event`]
//! enums and the [`transition`] function. It has no run-loop, no queue, no
//! actions, and no OS or transport dependencies — so the transition graph can
//! be reasoned about and tested in isolation. The run-loop and the work
//! handlers live in `openprot_lifecycle_sm`.

/// States of the PRoT lifecycle.
///
/// The graph mirrors the ASPEED PFR lifecycle but trimmed to what an OpenPRoT
/// target needs for first bring-up. Intel-specific and seamless-update states
/// are intentionally omitted; add them behind the same [`transition`] function
/// if a target requires them.
///
/// Hierarchical parent states (`Tmin1` / `Tzero` in the original) are not
/// encoded as enum variants here. Shared entry/exit behaviour is instead the
/// responsibility of the `Actions` implementation in the `sm` crate, which can
/// branch on the target state. This keeps the transition table flat and total.

pub enum State {
    /// Power-on entry state. The machine sits here until [`Event::Start`].
    Boot,
    /// One-time platform/RoT initialization.
    Init,
    /// The RoT booted from its secondary image and must self-recover.
    RotRecovery,
    /// Authenticate the active platform firmware image.
    FirmwareVerify,
    /// Restore platform firmware from a known-good recovery image.
    FirmwareRecovery,
    /// Apply a staged firmware update.
    FirmwareUpdate,
    /// Provisioning has not been performed; await a provisioning command.

    /// Request a platform reset.

}

/// Events that drive the lifecycle.
///
/// Events are produced both externally (commands, watchdog, reset detection)
/// and internally by `Actions` handlers reporting the outcome of work they
/// performed (e.g. [`Event::VerifyDone`] after a successful verify). The latter
/// is what re-drives the loop, exactly as `GenerateStateMachineEvent` did in
/// the original.
