//! # Lifecycle Server
//!
//! The platform-independent lifecycle *service*: the server end of the
//! lifecycle IPC channel. External producers — command transports, the
//! watchdog, reset-detect IRQs — send requests to inject lifecycle [`Event`]s
//! or query state; this crate decodes those requests, drives the
//! [`StateMachine`], and produces responses.
//!
//! Like `openprot_mctp_server`, the I/O is abstracted out so the logic is host
//! testable: the request/response *codec* and the *dispatch* onto the state
//! machine are pure and syscall-free (see [`Request`], [`Response`], and
//! [`LifecycleServer::dispatch`]). The target glue reads a request off a
//! `pw_kernel` channel, calls [`LifecycleServer::handle_request`] to get the
//! response bytes, and writes them back — the same `channel_read` →
//! handle → `channel_respond` shape as `StreamServer::handle_ipc`, with the
//! syscalls kept in the target-only `openprot_lifecycle_ipc` crate.
//!
//! The server is generic over [`Actions`]: a real target supplies handlers that
//! call OpenPRoT services and HAL traits; host tests supply a scripted double,
//! exactly as the `sm` integration test does.
